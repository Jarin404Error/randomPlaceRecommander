This project is a simple, single-page web application designed to showcase the beauty and cultural heritage of Nepal. Each time the page is loaded, it presents a random, high-quality image of a famous Nepalese landmark along with a detailed description.

This was created as a special gift for classmates in a Communications (COMM) elective course. It is the destination for a QR code embedded on Sanskrit name cards, serving as a digital window into my home country.
